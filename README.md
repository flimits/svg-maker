# svg-maker
This node application will dynamically create either a circle, square or rectangular svg image


## Psuedo Coding

The following is a psuedo coding practice that enables the user to plan out the way they should create this application; in a thoughtful, and visual way. It is not the code, just a framework.

- use inquirer to accept user input
Questions:  text, text color, shape, shape color
answers stores all these values
- create an svg template , and replace it with values from prompts string literls
- inside lib create a shape class that is then extended by Triangle, Circle and Square and those 3 shapes are exported.
- test for the shape class as well as the svg
- If the svg is passed a color , the svg should be of that color
how do we create svg =>
- expect(shape.render()).toEqual('<polygon points="150, 18 244, 182 56, 182" fill="blue" />');
- how do we create svg?
- we take in 4 inputs
- Shape Class needs to know what Color it is.
-   should have an attribute to store color!

* svg needs to give us a string that looks like an HTML.
* svg Class optional but could provide the svg details like color, text shape and text color.
<!-- Size is pre defined 300x200 px  -->
    Questions
    1. what text - upto 3
    2. text-color: string
    3. shape: one from list
    4. Shape color: string
Switch case to create an instance of the shape that the user wants
we modify the SVG template literas to accomodate user inputs
We write the svg file to file location using writefile
Test
tests should test
1.what functions return,
2.the classes are classes of that instance and
3.if a value is passed to class, it is set correctly.
HINT !!!   test create an SVG !!!
